# Drift
Drift is a development tool for building and publishing relational databases. With Drift, you can define you data structure and logic, migrate your data structure as it changes over time, and publish changes to multiple database providers. Drift leverages [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com) to provide support for publishing to multiple database providers.

The primary way to use Drift is via its command line interface (CLI). However, some actions can be performed with the NodeJS API.
